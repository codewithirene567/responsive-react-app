# Responsive React App

To review and improve my technical skillset in JavaScript React with a modern design, I have decided to follow, build, and then customize a React app by using a tutorial from YouTube. The tutorial in question originally came from the following YouTube video by a guy named Brian at this video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s.

This website will completely start from nothing though and will be manually built. I will not be copying and pasting any of his code because I want to gain more step by step experience with React.

The purpose of the site is basically a modern travel website with an extremely responsive user interface. I will be editing it at the very end to customize it with my own style and more features to improve the site.

One really cool feature with this site besides the styling and very organized structure is the consistent use of React Hooks, a useful tool from React version 16.8.

## How to install the app
